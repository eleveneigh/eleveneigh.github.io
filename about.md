# About Me

I'm a junior majoring in **Computer Science** and **Applied Mathematics** at Duke Kunshan University. My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), affective computing, and AI-assisted creativity.

## Research Focus

I am especially curious about how **music**, **visual stimuli**, and **interactive design** can contribute to emotional regulation and mental well-being. My work explores the therapeutic potential of technology in supporting mental health and emotional well-being.
