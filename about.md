I'm a junior majoring in CS and Applied Mathematics at Duke Kunshan University. My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), affective computing, and AI-assisted creativity. I am especially curious about how music, visual stimuli, and interactive design can contribute to emotional regulation and mental well-being. After graduation, I hope to pursue a PhD in this area and continue building human-centered technologies that care.
