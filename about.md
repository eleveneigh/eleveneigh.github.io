# About

I'm a CS & Applied Mathematics student at Duke Kunshan University, researching at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction**, **affective computing**, and **AI-assisted creativity**.

## Research Focus

My work explores how technology can support emotional well-being and mental health through:

- **Therapeutic AI systems** that understand and respond to human emotions
- **AI-assisted creative tools** for reflective art-making processes
- **Interactive design** for mental health applications

## Goals

I'm working toward a PhD to continue developing human-centered technologies that care about emotional experiences and mental well-being.
