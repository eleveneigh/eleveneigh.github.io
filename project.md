# Projects

## Multi-Modal AI Creative Assistant

**Student Research Scholar (SRS) Program | Research Assistant, HCI Lab, DKU**  
*May - Aug 2025*

An innovative multi-modal AI creative assistant that integrates computer vision, natural language processing, and gesture recognition to provide real-time creative support and feedback.

**Key Features:**
- **Real-time Object Detection**: YOLOv8 for instant visual recognition
- **Material Recognition**: Grounded-SAM for understanding object materials and properties
- **Visual Language Understanding**: Qwen-VL-Plus for comprehensive scene analysis
- **Gesture Control**: MediaPipe integration for intuitive interaction
- **Generative AI**: Suno and Qwen's Sambert for real-time audio and narrative feedback

**Research Impact:**
- Conducted comprehensive user research with N=15 participants through usability testing
- Facilitated brainstorming workshops (N=5) to gather initial design insights
- Performed thematic and statistical analysis revealing key differences between user (N=12) and expert (N=3) groups
- Co-lead authored full paper submitted to ACM CHI 2026 (under review)

**Technologies**: Python, YOLOv8, Grounded-SAM, Qwen-VL-Plus, MediaPipe, Suno, Qwen Sambert, HCI Research Methods
